Detailed Analysis & Recommendations

🔴 Critical SEO Issues
1. Missing Structured Data (JSON-LD)
Impact: Search engines can't properly index your content as articles, missing rich snippets
Current: Only basic meta tags
Needed: Article schema for Google, Bing, etc.
2. No Sitemap
Impact: Search engines may not discover all your content
Found: 0 sitemap files
3. Missing Canonical URLs
Impact: Risk of duplicate content penalties
Current: No canonical tags in any page
4. No Breadcrumbs
Impact: Poor navigation hierarchy for SEO and UX
Current: Only present in work section, missing in insights
5. No RSS Feed
Impact: Users can't subscribe to your content
Current: No feed.xml or rss.xml found

⚠️ User Experience Gaps
1. No Search/Filter Functionality
Issue: Users can't search or filter articles by tags/date
2. No Pagination
Issue: All posts load at once - will become slow with many articles
3. Reading Progress Only in Sidebar
Issue: Mobile users can't see reading progress (sidebar hidden on mobile)
4. Limited Social Sharing
Issue: Only native share API, no dedicated Twitter/LinkedIn/Facebook buttons

♿ Accessibility Concerns
1. Missing ARIA Labels
Issue: No role or aria-label for decorative elements
2. Loading States Without SR Announcements
Issue: Screen readers aren't notified when content loads
3. Image Alt Tags from CMS
Issue: Using title as alt text isn't ideal - should have dedicated alt text field

⚡ Performance Issues
1. No Image Optimization
Issue: Images aren't lazy loaded or optimized (WebP, AVIF)
2. GSAP ScrollTrigger Cleanup
Issue: Using onMount return for cleanup, should use onDestroy
3. All Content Loaded Eagerly
Issue: All markdown files loaded upfront

📱 Mobile UX Issues
Reading Progress Hidden: Sidebar with progress ring not visible on mobile
Share Button Position: Should be sticky/floating on mobile
Hero Height: 320px hero might be too tall on small screens

🌍 Global Standards Missing
No Language Declarations: Missing lang attribute on content
No Print Styles: Articles should have print-optimized styles
No Dark/Light Mode Toggle: Only dark mode available
Missing Updated/Modified Dates: Only publish date, no "last updated"
No Article Word Count: Helpful for readers
No Table of Contents: Long articles need navigation
